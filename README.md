# Maze-Solver
The Maze Solver (ME) application is a Java-based 2D grid that aims to find the shortest possible path between a starting and ending point within a maze. This project includes a live demo to showcase the functionality and features of the application. The grid consists of different colored blocks, where white blocks represent obstacles and black blocks are accessible for pathfinding.

# Features
The project incorporates the following features:


Maze Grid: The application provides a 2D grid that represents the maze, consisting of various colored blocks.

Pathfinding Algorithm: A business logic algorithm is implemented to find the shortest path between the starting and ending points.

GUI (Graphical User Interface): The application's user interface is designed to be visually attractive and user-friendly.

# Project Structure

The development of the project will follow a systematic approach to ensure smooth progress. The steps involved are as follows:

Business Logic: Implement the algorithm responsible for finding the shortest path between the starting and ending points within the maze.

GUI Development: Create an interactive and visually appealing Graphical User Interface for the application.

Integration: Integrate the business logic with the GUI to provide a seamless user experience.

Demo Preparation: Prepare a live demo of the Maze Solver application to showcase its features and functionality.

Technologies Used

The following technologies will be utilized in the development of the Maze Solver application:

Java: The core programming language used for the project.
JavaFX: A framework for creating Java applications with a rich graphical user interface.
Maven: A build automation tool and dependency management tool for Java projects.
Git: A version control system for tracking changes in the source code and collaboration among team members.
